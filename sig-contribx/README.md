#SIG Contributor Experience

We need your help!!!

Developing and sustaining a healthy community of contributors is critical to scaling the project
and growing the ecosystem. We need to ensure our contributors are happy and productive, we need 
to break the [commit-rate ceiling we hit in July 2015](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/graphs/contributors),
and we need to get the monotonically growing PR merge latency and numbers of open PRs and issues under control.

  notifications for important events

* Inadequate and out-of-date contributor documentation
